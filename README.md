This crate offers even more rapid functions for formatting integers into
decimal format compared to the [itoa](https://crates.io/crates/itoa) crate.

## Comparison with `itoa` crate

If you desire to convert intergers into a decimal format and store them in a
`String`, `Vec` or any other contiguous buffer, then this crate will be the
best choice.

For writing integers to a `std::io::Write` or `std::fmt::Write`, both the
[itoa](https://github.com/dtolnay/itoa) crate and the `itoap` crate shows
nearly identical performance for certain types, although `itoap` is generally
faster.

The underlying implementation is based on the `sse2` algorithm from the
[itoa-benchmark](https://github.com/miloyip/itoa-benchmark) repository.
While the `itoa` crate processes integers from the **last** digits, this
algorithm operates from **first** digits, enabling direct writing of integers
to the buffer. Consequently, `itoap` outperforms `itoa` due to the efficiency.

## Benchmark result

Benchmark program was executed under the following environment:


|Hardware/Software|Version|
|--|--|
|CPU model name|Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8265U CPU @ 1.60GHz|
|CPU micro architecture|Sky Lake|
|Standard libc implementation|glibc 2.35.0|
|rustc|rustc 1.70.0-nightly (07e0e2ec2 2023-02-28)|

![Benchmark result](./bench.png)

:warning: performance of `itoa` crate highly depends on the CPU architecture and libc implementation.
